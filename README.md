# 🌱 Plants vs Zombies Clone (C++ & SFML)

A custom-built 2D tower defense game inspired by the classic **Plants vs Zombies**, developed using **C++** and **SFML** for rendering, animations, and real-time gameplay. This project replicates the core mechanics of the original game — plant placement, zombie movement, shooting, and collision handling — while helping me explore real-time game development and object-oriented design.

## 🎮 Features

- 🌻 **Plant Placement:** Click-based plant deployment on a grid
- 🧟 **Zombie Waves:** Periodic enemy spawns with movement towards the house
- 🔫 **Projectile System:** Plants shoot projectiles that hit and damage zombies
- 💥 **Collision Detection:** Accurate projectile-enemy interactions
- 🧠 **Basic AI:** Simple behavior patterns for enemies and player-controlled units
- 🎨 **2D Graphics:** Smooth animations and sprite handling using SFML

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Graphics & Windowing:** SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- **Concepts Used:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Game Loop, Event Handling, Collision Detection
